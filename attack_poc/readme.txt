The code in this folder aims at verifying the effectiveness of the proposed attack method against conventional end hopping mechanism, and 'OF-RHM' was taken as a case.

There is a brief description for the files in this fold.

OF-RHM:
	AddressHopping.py: used to realize OF-RHM in mininet enviroment.
	hopping.pcap: captured session protected with OF-RHM mechanism.
	hopping_topo.py: used to generate topo in mininet environment. 
FakeCodePoc.txt: description of the attack method written in fake code.
DataExtractPoc.py: sample code of the attack method written in python.
